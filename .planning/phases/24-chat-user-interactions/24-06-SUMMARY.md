# Phase 24 Plan 06: Automated behavior-closure Summary

**Real chat transport, signer rollback, host filtering, and App social-lifecycle evidence with secret-safe browser fixtures.**

## Accomplishments

- Added real three-context targeted-message/invite coverage with recipient-side stored-message inspection.
- Proved host and guest composer restoration after one-shot real NIP-07 signing failures.
- Added authenticated host ignored-streak expansion and generation-safe stale kind-3 ingress checks.
- Added a production-elided public App lifecycle probe; normal build excludes its marker.

## Task Commits

1. Task 1 — `c8434c7` test: targeted room transport
2. Task 2 — `1825c3c`, `f34989b`, `d059467` test/fix: composer rollback and host filtering
3. Task 3 — `79bbb89`, `f34989b` test: lifecycle ownership and stale ingress

## Verification

- Passed: composer rollback focused Playwright test (24.8s).
- Passed: host filtered-ignore focused Playwright test (20.6s).
- Passed: App lifecycle replacement/stale-ingress focused Playwright test (0.8s).
- Passed: `pnpm exec tsc --noEmit`, `pnpm build`, and normal-bundle marker scan.
- Pending rerun: targeted transport focused Playwright test; its first run was interrupted before a terminal result.

## Deviations from Plan

None in implementation scope. The task-1 focused verification needs a clean rerun before this summary can be promoted to complete.

## Self-Check: PASSED

- All three assigned implementation/test files exist.
- Commits `c8434c7`, `1825c3c`, `79bbb89`, `f34989b`, and `d059467` exist.

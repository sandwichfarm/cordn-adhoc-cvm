# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-08-02)

**Core value:** A single browser tab acts as a fully functional, self-sovereign Cordn coordinator reachable over Nostr relays — no backend, no account, no installation.
**Current focus:** Phase 24 — chat-user-interactions

## Current Position

Phase: 18 — Unified Presence, Notifications & Controls
Plan: Not started
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-08-07 — Phase 25 complete, transitioned to Phase 18
Pull request: [#12 — participant chat interactions](https://github.com/sandwichfarm/CAHMLS/pull/12) — open, CI in progress. [#9](https://github.com/sandwichfarm/CAHMLS/pull/9) merged 2026-08-06.

Progress: [██████████░░░░░░░░░░] 3/6 phases ([█████████░] 94%)

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Phase 15] Persist only a version and validated 32-byte secret hex; malformed present records require explicit recovery.
- [Phase 15] Retain the anonymous signer independently of NIP-07/NIP-46 and zeroize it on retirement.
- [Phase 15] Require the active signer for all new room authority; room-local secrets are legacy-only migration material.
- [Phase 15] Treat `(coordinatorPubkey, roomId)` as the sole room identity and journal exact storage before retirement commit.
- [Phase 15] Use the versioned non-secret recovery marker as the irreversible boundary before signer replacement is published.
- [Phase 16]: Unread state is keyed by coordinator pubkey plus room ID and established at the initial sync baseline.
- [Phase 16]: Unread announcement history remains non-reactive bookkeeping to prevent Svelte update loops.
- [Phase 16]: Coordinator transport readiness is not running readiness; exact hosted-room recovery completes the startup transaction.
- [Phase 16]: Recovery uses three injected 4-second attempts with injected 250ms and 750ms backoff, preserving no raw error details.
- [Phase 16]: Local chat renders only after a completed recovery state and an attached connected exact session.
- [Phase 16]: An exhausted room can be deleted only through its exact contextual confirmation, after which startup resumes on the existing transport.
- [Phase 16]: Multi-room recovery preserves the remembered exact room as the active channel after every room is restored.
- [Phase ?]: Startup is pane-scoped to host-chat; global header and rail remain usable.
- [Phase ?]: Signal animation consumes a typed read-only projection of coordinator startup progress.
- [Phase ?]: Startup motion owns only the positioned host-chat pane; header and rail remain usable.
- [Phase ?]: One scoped GSAP context and media owner consumes immutable recovery projections and reverts on teardown.
- [Phase ?]: Wide-pane content coverage requires a 512x256 deterministic ASCII texture plus rendered extent assertions.
- [Phase ?]: [Phase 18] Feed-first notification recording is canonical; browser delivery remains an optional cadence-gated projection.
- [Phase ?]: [Phase 18] Invitation resolution persists only ID/timestamp for seven days and remains independent from read state.
- [Phase ?]: Separate the in-app notification feed from desktop permission controls; opening settings stays passive.
- [Phase ?]: Require a live trusted invitation capability at accept time; persisted feed history remains non-redeemable.
- [Phase ?]: [Phase 24] Recipient pubkeys are canonicalized and authenticated in kind-9 metadata; invite visibility filters only valid targeted invites before grouping.
- [Phase ?]: Ignore preferences reuse the authoritative coordinator+room composite identity with a normalized participant suffix.
- [Phase ?]: Highlights are global by normalized participant pubkey and persist only locked palette symbols.
- [Phase ?]: Kind-3 identity acceptance requires canonical event-hash equality plus signature verification before deterministic ordering.
- [Phase ?]: Follow queue captures its originating identity generation and commits only after one relay accepts the signed replacement.
- [Phase ?]: MessageGroup owns one non-self action menu while panes retain typed composer and room callbacks.
- [Phase ?]: Ignored disclosure state is keyed after recipient filtering and remains private ephemeral UI state.
- [Phase ?]: Phase 24 participant menus and choosers pass an explicit 16px gutter, preserving the global overlay default.
- [Phase ?]: Phase 24 highlight state is rendered from the typed persisted prop with named text, aria-pressed, and a visible selected marker.
- [Phase ?]: Phase 24 participant and room identifiers are excluded from affected DOM IDs while focus restoration remains pane-local.
- [Phase ?]: Favorites persist only validated coordinator-plus-room composite keys and reconcile against active rooms.
- [Phase ?]: Shared invite Join defaults to unavailable and enables only for an exact online workspace reachability result.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Production nsite publication requires repository secrets. The deploy workflow currently succeeds as a guarded skip.
- Authoritative active user count is not yet derived from real Cordn group membership.
